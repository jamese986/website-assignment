# Front-End Web Assignment 2017
This readme file details the approach and creation of my website which I'm submitting for my final assignment for the CTEC3905-2018-Y Front-End Web Development module. I have chosen to base my website on representing a fictional society at DMU the "DMU - PHP Society" the website is meant to be clean and aesthetically pleasing and provide general insight in to the society as well as have things like blog posts and a contact us feature. This site could easily be added to the DSU society page and provide a very useful tool for the society.

## Getting Started
To initial get started with this front end assignment, I first created the folder structure on my local machine. After the basic structure was in place I initialized GIT into the folder. I then pushed my initial commit to GitHub.

## Software / Resources Used
the following is a list of software I used to create and carry out the assignment:
* Sublime Text 3 
* Photoshop
* GitHub
* Firefox
* Chrome
* Window Resizer plugin for Chrome 
* Iphone & Ipad
* Android Phone & Tablet
* Flexsider

## Mock Up
I used Photoshop to create a very basic mock up of some of the elements of my website. I used a variety of Apple devices to show how the main elements of the site will be responsive.

## Homepage Design & Build
I have created a video to discuss my design approach [the video can be found here](https://youtu.be/qM0DMhy39V4).
My initial concept for this project was to create a one page website. I knew I wanted my design and aesthetics to revolve around some key design characteristics: 
#### Clean, Modern and Minimalistic
The website is aimed at tech savvy developers and people who are going to be knowledgeable about the latest web design trends. Firstly I wanted my website to be clean tidy and Minimalistic in it's initial presentation to the site visitors. This serves 2 purposes firstly from a design point of view it looks very pleasing and secondly a clean well structured site allows for information to be easily found. This allows people with accessibility issue to navigate far easier than something like a Geocities website from the 90's.

The modern aspects of the design come in the form of a functional cross device cross platform responsiveness that means no matter the device the site will always look pleasing and remain functional. 

#### Added Google Maps API above the contact us page for greater clarity and added a pop up window and custom marker.

## Standalone Blog post page
I decided to add an additional page to my website as there was no feasible way to display all the content needed for a blog post on the main page. I did look into accordion type drop downs and a few other methods but ultimately decided to settle with a standalone blog post page as it allows for more of a continuous feel for the site.

The page features a main blog post headed with an image as well as a related posts section and to finish off it has the same sponsorship area and footer as the homepage.

Clean, stylish and accessible. 

## Website Testing
I have created a testing video in which myself and another student carry out testing and discuss our findings [the video can be found here](https://youtu.be/qrXkA7N3wOA). 
Obviously we weren't able to record the whole testing process but some of the things identified and fixed are listed below:

* Adjusted images sizes to look better across all devices
* Double checked all links are working 
* fixed newsletter breakpoint issues
* fixed map breaking

## Deployment
To deploy the website instead of pushing the site to the public html fodlers on the university computers or other servers. Deployment will come in the form of pushing the final version of the assignment to git. Where pages will be viewed view the GitHub Live view URL.

I have created a video discussing multiple aspects and processes of the assignment [the video can be found here](https://youtu.be/fMeZ6FKETTA),
