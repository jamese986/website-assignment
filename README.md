# Front-End Web Assignment 2017
This readme file details the approach and creation of my website which I'm submitting for my final assignment for the CTEC3905-2018-Y Front-End Web Development module. I have chosen to base my website on representing a fictional society at DMU the "DMU - PHP Society" the website is meant to be clean and aesthetically pleasing and provide general insight in to the society as well as have things like blog posts and a contact us feature. This site could easily be added to the DSU society page and provide a very useful tool for the society.

## Getting Started
To initial get started with this front end assignment, I first created the folder structure on my local machine. After the basic structure was in place I initialized GIT into the folder. I then pushed my initial commit to GitHub.

* Sublime Text 3
